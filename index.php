	</br>
	<strong><ul>Front-end development and everything related to it is just a skill and any skill, believe it or not is learnable.</ul></strong>
	<strong><ul>Be prepared to put up with late nights exploring other websites, experimenting with a new plugins and frameworks, reading web development blogs, listening to podcasts and chewing through thousands of tweets.</ul></strong>

<P>
	And the most important thing</br>
	<strong>Find a mentor!</strong> 
	<strong>You are keen to learn,
		<ol><strong><li> but not sure where to start?</li></strong><strong><li>What should you learn next?</li></strong> <li>How to implement this or that?</li></ol>

Thatâ€™s what mentors are great for.
<p>

Find someone with more experience than you, someone who is keen to help you to grow.

Your mentor should be someone who you respect, someone who you would like to be like. Someone who can teach you how to code and what to avoid doing.

This could be your boss, your colleague </strong>
		<strong><p>A good mentor will help you:
to get advice on your project approach
to get a sense of direction
to help you foresee any potential roadblocks</p></strong>

	<strong>
		Remember a mentor is not a guy who will do everything instead of you and is not there to motivate you. You still need to be curious and self-motivated in order to grow.
